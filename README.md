# conda-env-setup-scripts
This repository contains scripts to set up Conda environments for JAX, PyTorch, and TensorFlow with CUDA support. Each script creates a new environment, installs the necessary packages, and configures environment variables for CUDA support.


## Environments

- **JAX Environment**: JAX with CUDA support and Keras.
- **PyTorch Environment**: PyTorch with CUDA support and Keras.
- **TensorFlow Environment**: TensorFlow with CUDA support.

## Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/conda-env-setup-scripts.git
cd conda-env-setup-scripts

### 2. Choose the script for the environment you want to set up and run it.

- **JAX Environment**: bash jax_env_setup.sh
- **PyTorch Environment**: bash pytorch_env_setup.sh
- **TensorFlow Environment**: bash tensorflow_env_setup.sh
